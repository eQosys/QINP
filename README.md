# QINP

QINP is a statically typed, procedural programming language which is inspired by the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages.

!!! QINP is a work in progress and therefore not yet stable and may be subject to breaking changes !!!

At the moment only Linux (full) and Windows (partial) are supported (both x86_64).

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to build QINP can be found in the  [Documentation](./docs/home.md#getting-started).
The Documentation outlines the basic working concepts of the QINP language, how to use the Compiler and includes the [Standard Library Reference](./docs/stdlib/stdlib.md)

A good starting point to get to know the QINP language are the [examples](./examples/) and the [tests](./tests/).
