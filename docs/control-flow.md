### if-elif-else

If-elif-else statements are used to execute different code depending on the value of a condition.
The conditions may be any expression that evaluates (possibly through implicit conversion) to a boolean.
The elif and else statements are optional.

#### Usage

```qinp
if [condition]:
	[body]
elif [condition]:
	[body]
else:
	[body]
```

#### Example:

```qinp
if true:
	std.print("Hello")
elif false:
	std.print("World")
else:
	std.print("!")
```

---

### while loop

While loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition evaluates to true.

#### Usage

```qinp
while [condition]:
	[body]
```

#### Example

```qinp
var<u32> i = 0
while ++i < 10:
	std.print(i)	\\ Prints the numbers 1 to 9
	std.print("\n")
```

---

### do-while loop

Do-while loops are used to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeat the loop as long as the condition evaluates to true.

#### Usage

```qinp
do:
	[body]
while [condition]
```

#### Example

```qinp
var<u32> i = 0
do:
	std.print(i)	\\ Prints the numbers 0 to 9
	std.print("\n")
while ++i < 10
```

---

### continue

The `continue` statement can be used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop. This can be useful to ignore the rest of the code in a loop without using conditional statement.

#### Example

```qinp
var<u32> i = 0
while ++i < 10:
	if i == 5:
		continue
	std.print(i)
```

### break

The `break` statement can be used to break out of a loop.
The remaining code in the loop is not executed.

#### Example

```qinp
var<u32> i = 0
while ++i < 10:
	if i == 5:
		break
	std.print(i)
```
